## Working rules

- Use simple, direct.straighforward language (STE English). Keep explanations concise, example-based, and focused on the problem. Simplify without oversimplifying.
- If a requirement or intended behavior is unclear, ask instead of assuming.
- Do not monkey-patch globals, prototypes, or third-party modules. If a change appears to require monkey-patching, stop and ask first.
- Prefer simple, easily removable code over premature abstractions. Do not introduce a new abstraction unless explicitly requested.
- Do not use comments inside the code unless asked. If you want to do it, review code and make it self-explanatory instead.
- Use a test-first approach for behavior changes. Name tests after observable behavior from the usage perspective, not implementation details.
- Treat questions, design discussions, and requests for opinions as read-only. Wait for explicit approval before editing files or running mutating commands.
- Never reverse a decision already agreed to (a requirement, a behaviour, a test that guards it) unless explicitly approved by that specific reversal. Ask user and explain tradeoffs.
- Plan to use subagents, when available, for independent, non-sequential work that can usefully run in parallel, such as research, repository exploration, focused implementation, verification, and review. Keep user interaction, cross-cutting decisions, and final synthesis in the main context. Ask for that usage before sending them. Give subagents sufficient context and require concrete, evidence-backed findings so important details are not lost.
- Do not commit, create branches or tags, rebase, reset, or otherwise modify Git history unless explicitly requested.
- Do not add manual line breaks inside Markdown paragraphs. Keep each paragraph on a single line and let the renderer or editor wrap it.
